    <h1>Tattoo</h1>
    <article>
      <section>
        <p><strong>A tattoo</strong> is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. The art of making tattoos is <strong>tattooing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); and pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). In addition, tattoos can be used for identification such as ear tattoos on livestock as a form of branding.</p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>The word <em>tattoo</em>, or <em>tattow</em> in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Samoan word <em>tatau</em>, meaning "to strike". The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> gives the etymology of tattoo as <q>In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.</q> Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring or staining.</p>
        <p>The etymology of the body modification term is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat or performance &mdash; see <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tattoo">military tattoo</a></em>. In this case, the English word <em>tattoo</em> is derived from the Dutch word <em>taptoe</em>.</p>
        <p>Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as "flash", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.</p>
        <p>The Japanese word <em>irezumi</em> means "insertion of ink" and can mean tattoos using <em>tebori</em>, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine or any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is <em>horimono</em>. Japanese may use the word <em>tattoo</em> to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing.</p>
        <p>British anthropologist Ling Roth in 1900 described four methods of skin marking and suggested they be differentiated under the names "tatu", "moko", "cicatrix" and "keloid". The first is by pricking that leaves the skin smooth, as found in places including the Pacific Islands, the second a tattoo combined with chiselling to leave furrows in the skin, as found in places including New Zealand, the third is scarification using a knife or chisel, as found in places including West Africa, and the fourth is scarification by irritating and re-opening a preexisting wound, rescarification, to form a raised scar, as found in places including Tasmania, Australia, Melanesia, and Central Africa. <q>Impicit in the classification was an evolutionary development from the most primitive form of body modification [the last] to the most sophisticated [the first].</q></p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Tattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within successive generations of macrophages, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.</p>
